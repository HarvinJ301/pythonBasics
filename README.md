# pythonBasics

This is were I and others can track my journey to learning the python language <br/>

25/09/2023

I have started learning more into the datatypes within python - much of it is the same as other programming languages I have used such as Java <br/>
Learning the syntax python uses is important however as there are little things that are different than languages I have previously used. <br/>
I have learnt about numbers and strings so far but there is still a few more datatypes I need to go into. <br/>

Finished off the datatypes for python by doing booleans <br/>
Started looking at collection types within python first up being Lists - have a few things left then onto tuple hopefully some time tomorrow.
